# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is a college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database.  Describe how to use your program.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

{Describe the cloud database you are using.}

{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to develop my software, Firebase Realtime Database to house my cloud database, and GitHub to host the code publicly so all can see the work I have done here on my cloud database.

The programming language I used for this project was Python 3.10 and the library I used for this project was firebase admin.

You can download the latest version of Python for your OS [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and you can find the installation process for the library in the [Useful Websites](#useful-websites) link titled How to Get Started With Firebase using Python.

You can create a free account for Firebase [here](https://firebase.google.com/). Follow the [Useful Websites](#useful-websites) link mentioned above to get started with doing that.

You can download the latest version of Visual Studio Code for your OS [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and can find the GitHub main website [here](https://github.com/). Feel free to create an account and fork the repo if you would like!

# Future Work
* When modifying users, check the levels of access the user has, and see if they can make changes or not
* Adding account classification to each user such as Admin, Normal, and others for the reason above
* Adding more options to add other things to the accounts, like bank info, id numbers, etc.
